smartpass.evaluator

Password strength evaluator:
- estimate_entropy(password): conservative estimate of entropy (bits)
- detect patterns: dictionary words, leet substitutions, repeated sequences,
  sequential runs, keyboard patterns, years/dates
- score_password(password): returns dict with entropy, penalties, final_bits,
  score (0-100), label, explanations (list of strings), and suggestions (list)
